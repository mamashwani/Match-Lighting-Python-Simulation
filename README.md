# Match-Lighting-Python-Simulation
Write a program that makes use of the lists to solve a problem and file output to save the results.


# Problem:  
-Using python, write a program that will simulate a special physics demonstration that would otherwise be difficult to set up. Imaging a number of wooden matches are arranged upright on a grid. The matches are positioned at the same level and at integer locations (inches) on an X-Y grid. A special laser is placed at the origin that projects a fan of laser light onto the field of matches. 
- We would like to know which (or how many) matches in the field are ignited and which (or how many) are not.
- Request the name for the output file to be used to save the results. 
- Request the width and height of the field of matches as positive whole numbers.
- Determine the matches which are ignited and which are not.
- If both the sizes are below 80, display grid with the results to the screen and write this result into a file with the specified name. If either size value is above 80, simply display and record  to the file the number of lit and unlit matches without drawing the grid.
- Use the program to answer the question: How many matches are unlit for a 1000x1000 field?
